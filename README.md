A 35-key ortholinear keyboard with a 6.25u space bar. 

I have decided to share the gerber file for this board, feel free to make one and enjoy.

If you assemble one, I would advise soldering (1)diodes, then (2)controller headers, then (3)switches, then (4)controller, or you are going to run into clearance issues. Everything else is self-explanatory.
